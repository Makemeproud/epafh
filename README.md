Epafh
=====

Epafh (pronounce *\[epaf√≠\]*), is a tool to extract all email addresses from your
mail boxes. Thus helping you into filling your CRM tool.

It starts by fetching existing email addresses from your CRM, then it connects
on your mailserver to read all emails and check for missing contacts in your
CRM.

For the moment it only supports IMAP mail servers and FatFreeCRM servers.

The next move on the roadmap is POP3 support and maybe some other CRM.
